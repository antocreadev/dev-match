    "detailed_bio": "I am a passionate and highly accomplished Full-stack developer with a Master's degree (Mention Très Bien) in Full Stack Web and Mobile Development from Università di Corsica. Born and raised in Nice, France, I discovered my love for programming at age 14 when I built my first website for a local bakery. Since then, I've transformed that early curiosity into a thriving career spanning web development, artificial intelligence, and entrepreneurship.\n\nMy expertise spans both front-end and back-end development, allowing me to architect and design complete, high-performance applications tailored to modern market needs. I master numerous front-end libraries and frameworks including React, Next.js, Solid.js, Vue.js, Svelte, and Astro, while excelling in back-end development with Node.js, Python (FastAPI, Django, Flask), PHP (Laravel, Symfony), and modern API architectures including REST, GraphQL, and gRPC.\n\nMy technical proficiency extends across TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), Python, PHP, HTML5, CSS3, Sass, TailwindCSS, Bash scripting, and SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL). I'm particularly skilled in modern state management solutions (Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Jotai), server-side rendering, static site generation, and progressive web applications. My algorithmic thinking, honed through competitive programming and academic research, enables me to tackle complex challenges from real-time image processing to distributed systems optimization.\n\nIn the AI/ML domain, I've developed expertise in neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision, and vector databases (Qdrant, Pinecone). I've implemented custom transformer models, fine-tuned LLMs for domain-specific tasks, and built production-ready ML pipelines processing millions of data points daily. My work includes developing a voice recognition system achieving 98% accuracy and creating recommendation engines serving 10,000+ daily users.\n\nAs co-founder and CTO of Mindlet 🐙, the first social network dedicated to collaborative learning, I lead a team of 6 developers in combining proven pedagogical methods with cutting-edge AI to revolutionize how people learn and share knowledge. We've achieved product-market fit with 10,000+ active users across 15 countries, secured seed funding of €500K, and maintain a 4.8/5 app store rating. The platform leverages spaced repetition algorithms, AI-powered content recommendations, real-time collaborative features, and cross-platform synchronization (web, iOS, Android).\n\nMy professional journey includes remarkable achievements: winning the DataVi'Z National Competition 2024 with an innovative data visualization platform; serving as lead developer on the GOLIAT international project where I architected a sophisticated drone-based thermal imaging analysis system processing 500GB+ of data and serving government agencies across 3 continents; contributing to open-source projects with 2,500+ combined GitHub stars; and speaking at 4 local tech meetups on topics ranging from microservices architecture to AI ethics.\n\nI'm proficient in DevOps practices including CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), containerization (Docker, though I'm still mastering Kubernetes), cloud platforms (AWS, Vercel, Railway), monitoring and logging (Sentry, LogRocket), and infrastructure as code. My project management skills encompass Agile/Scrum methodologies, technical documentation, code review best practices, and mentoring junior developers.\n\nBeyond pure coding, I'm passionate about UI/UX design, having created interfaces that balance aesthetic appeal with usability. I'm proficient in Figma, Adobe Illustrator, and Photoshop, allowing me to bridge the gap between design and development seamlessly. I believe great software is not just functional but also beautiful and intuitive.\n\nMy work philosophy centers on clean code, test-driven development, continuous learning, and collaborative problem-solving. I'm known for my ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, my attention to detail, and my relentless drive to ship quality products. I thrive in fast-paced startup environments where I can wear multiple hats and make significant impact.\n\nWhen I'm not coding, I'm running marathons (5 completed, best time 3h42), exploring specialty coffee shops across Europe (47 visited so far), reading tech blogs and research papers, contributing to open-source projects, and constantly experimenting with new technologies. I believe in maintaining work-life balance and that physical activity enhances cognitive performance and creativity.\n\nI'm fluent in French (native), English (C1 level), and Italian (B2 level), which has enabled me to work on international teams and attend conferences across Europe. I'm always eager to learn and stay at the forefront of web, mobile, and AI technologies, constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code. My ultimate goal is to build technology that makes a meaningful difference in people's lives while fostering a community of passionate, talented developers."
